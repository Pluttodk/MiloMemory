# Coding style practice

The code should always be written in node.js, and the style should ideally always follow the below pattern:

- Single responsibility
- Use Typing to define the types that are used
- Specify classes for objects
- Methods signatures should always have types annotated to them
- Create components and make it easy to extend.
- The ui should be simplistic and beautiful.
- The ui should work on both mobile and web

### Docs:
All methods should have docs after its signature, with a short description of what it is supposed to do

# Running the code
The code is always managed using npm. That is.

### Adding packages
`npm install`

### Running a specific file
`npm run dev`

# Evaluating the examples
Always try to run the code alterations in the @terminal, and use the output to validate if the alterations work

# Changelog
Write a small changelog summarizing what was altered in a markdown file
